# Election Analysis

## Overview

We were tasked at analyzing the results of the recent election in the state of Colorado. We decided to take a look at 3 key counties that became a deciding factor in this election.

## Election-Audit Results

#### We can see the following with this table
* The total votes cast are 369,711
* Denver had the county 306,055 making it the largest turnout rate
* Diana DeGette is the winner with a resounding 74% of the vote (272,892 votes)
* Stockham came in second with 23% of the vote (85,213 votes)
* Anthony Doane rounded out the group with 3% of the vote (11,606 votes)

## Election-Audit Summary

As we can see the code worked perfectly at gathering and sorting the data from these counties. There is a tremendous amount of potential for this code, some uses I could propose is using the code to analyize the counties with the least amount of turnout. That way we could discover which areas need more voter outreach so we can get more people active in our elections so more people can have thier voices heard. Another way I could think of is using it to examine the effectiveness of the winners campaign; find out which policies, personalities and canvassing methods work the best. Our goal is to gain clairty through numbers and I believe we achieved that with flying colors.
